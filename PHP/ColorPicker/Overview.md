# Overview

**EJ PHP ColorPicker** wrapper provides you a rich visual interface for color selection. You can select the color from the professionally designed palettes or custom color. By clicking a point on the color, you can change the active color to the color that is located under the pointer. 

You can also choose colors in different specifications; red-green-blue-alpha (opacity) (RGBA), hue-saturation-value (HSV) and hexadecimal (HEX). The ColorPicker provides a selection of basic colors, standard presets, custom colors and color swatches.
