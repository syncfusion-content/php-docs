## Schedule

###  Breaking Changes
{:#schedule-breaking-changes}

*  We have now integrated into our source - the time conversion process of appointmentâ€™s start and end time to Universal (UTC) time before updating to database; and another conversion of the same to the local time on initial fetch up from database before assigning to Schedule `dataSource`. Therefore, the explicit appointment time conversions from application end is no more needed.
