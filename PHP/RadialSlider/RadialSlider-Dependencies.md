# RadialSlider Dependencies

The external script dependencies of the RadialSlider control are,

•	jQuery 1.7.1 and later versions.

And the internal script dependencies of the RadialSlider control are:

<table>
<tr>
<th>
File                          </th><th>
Description/Usage</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
[`ej.core.min.js`]</td><td>
Must be referred always before using all the JS controls.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
[`ej.touch.min.js`]</td><td>
For providing touch support.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
[`ej.radialslider.min.js`]</td><td>
This is the main source file specific for rendering RadialSlider.</td></tr>
</table> 

To get the real appearance of the RadialSlider, the dependent CSS file `ej.web.all.min.css` (which includes styles of all the controls) should also needs to be referred.

>Note:Uncompressed version of library files are also available which is used for development or debugging purpose and can be generated from the custom script [here](http://csg.syncfusion.com/).
